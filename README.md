==========================

## Functionality:

* Upon initial start, all variables are set to 0, the random number is set to a number between 19-120.
* The 4 image files will also randomly choose a number between 1-12.
* When either of the images are clicked they're added against the previous "score" variable.
* If the score variable is = to the current random number, the game will display a win message and reset all variables except the winning or losses scores.
* If the score variable is becomes greater than the current random number, a losing message will display and a loss point will add.

*This project was to show simply DOM manipulation use jQuery*
